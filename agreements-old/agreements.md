Enspiral Agreements
===================
[February, 2014](https://www.loomio.org/d/ORgnT6LY/enspiral-agreements) | [Overview](https://github.com/enspiral/agreements/blob/master/README.md)

This document outlines what Enspiral Agreements are, how they are created, and how they are changed.

###Overview
As the form of Enspiral emerges from our collective imaginings it is useful to document things to make our culture and processes explicit. This ensures we are all on the same page and makes it easier for new people to understand Enspiral and how it works.

Each one of these documents is an Enspiral Agreement and collectively they are the best answer we have to the question ‘What is Enspiral and how does it work?’.

###Creating
The process for creating an agreement is quite straightforward

1. Create a document with the word [draft] in the title and make it publicly editable.
1. Create a new Loomio in the general Enspiral group and allow at least a week for discussion.
1. Change the  permissions to comment only and create a proposal to formally accept the agreement.
1. Once the proposal passes remove the word draft, put in a link to the loomio discussion and the date it was passed and drop it in the Agreements Folder and update the Enspiral Overview doc with a short description.

###Updating

1. Create a copy of the existing agreement and make the changes you think it needs
1. Create a new Loomio in the general Enspiral group with a link to the previous Loomio, the existing agreement and an overview of the changes. Allow at least a week for discussion.
1. Same as above.
1. Move the previous agreement to the old folder and follow step 4 above.
