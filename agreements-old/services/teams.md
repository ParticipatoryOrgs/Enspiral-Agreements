# Enspiral Services Team Agreement


Groups of people working in Enspiral Services Ltd. can optionally form into teams. Operating as a team has some special processes, and this document is our shared agreement about how we would like that to work. A team is not just a random group of people, it is a concept that is a core part of Enspiral Services structure, and to avoid confusion we’d like the term “team” or “Enspiral Services team” to be used specifically to refer to teams created and operating as per this agreement. 

## Key Responsibilities of a Team

When a team is formed, its members take on the following responsibilities:

* To communicate clearly to the rest of Enspiral what the team represents, who it consists of, and what it does.
* To keep the rest of services informed of the team’s activity, just in general overview, by participating in some process facilitated by core group (currently team reports in the minutes).
* To manage team contributions as described in this agreement, or to opt out of receiving them.
* To maintain an up to date register of the team’s customers and projects, and to provide ongoing customer care for those projects as per this agreement, even if the individuals who worked on those projects have left the team.
* To ensure that the team brand (if it has one) complies with both the Enspiral Ventures agreement and the law.
* To wind up the team as per this agreement if they no longer wish to have these responsibilities.
* To ensure they represent themselves with integrity and have the necessary skills and experience within the team to provide the service/s offered, and that this quality is maintained.

##Team Members

A team will register a set of two or more members with services core. A team may have any membership structure it likes, including involving people in the team’s activities who are not members, but it is the members who ensure that the team’s responsibilities are met.

Team members will always have an Enspiral Services contract, and will always be Enspiral contributors or members. People can be part of more than one team.

##Team Decision Making

We’d like teams to feel free to invent their own processes. Enspiral Services is designed to be a sandbox for new and interesting ways of doing business. However, we also hold certain values at Enspiral regarding communication and empowerment. Each team shall have a founding document which describes their processes for working together and making decisions. While this team constitution may take any form, we hold these principles to be important.

* Distribution of power amongst members of a team.
* A way for regular, ongoing and committed non-team-members to become part of the team.

##Team Identity

A team will have a clear identity that can be easily explained to the rest of Enspiral Services. This identity will include being clear on the sort of services offered by the team. 

A team may, but does not have to, maintain a public facing brand. 

###Internal Team

These are internal divisions only, and have no public facing brand. Internal teams still have an identity understood within Enspiral Services, and have all the other responsibilities of a team, but from the point of view of clients, they are just dealing with Enspiral Services. Internal teams will have no opportunity to publicly list their specific services on the Enspiral website and other Enspiral communications, but are not subject to the Enspiral Ventures agreement.

###Enspiral Ventures

A team which is known outside of Enspiral Services is considered to be an Enspiral Venture. Even though such a team is not a legal company, they look to the world a lot like one, and they are entitled to the same publicity as other Enspiral Ventures. 

The Enspiral Ventures agreement includes various responsibilities which apply to Enspiral Ventures, and these of course apply to such services teams, including the need to apply to Enspiral to form such a venture.

Since clients of such teams will receive invoices and contracts from Enspiral Services Ltd, it needs to be clear that such ventures are actually divisions of Enspiral Services. If a team chooses to do this by using the Enspiral name or logo in their brand, they should be aware that the Ventures agreement imposes additional responsibilities to ventures doing so.

Even when a team maintains its own name, and represents itself as such to it’s clients, that team is still firmly part of Enspiral Services. The team’s brand assets are owned by Enspiral Services as the team has no legal entity of it’s own, but Enspiral Services will not appropriate them for any use not endorsed by the team’s members. Team brand assets are managed by the team (see Team Assets).

Since Enspiral Services is legally responsible for any trademark infringement by a team, a team agrees to take responsibility to ensure that any name or other brand assets that they use are ones that Enspiral Services is legally allowed to use. Any required legal costs are borne by the team.

##Team Assets

A team is able to maintain money in virtual accounts, and also physical items purchased through Enspiral Services, just like a person can. A team, however, will manage these assets using its democratic decision making processes.

A team is not an ideal vehicle for receiving investment or issuing shares. A team has no authority to borrow money on behalf of Enspiral Services. A team may take crowd-sourced funds, and even return profit to those who work or invest in its projects, but must not guarantee returns.

If a team should decide to leave Enspiral Services and become a company, its assets can be moved to the company by Enspiral Services on consensus of the teams members. This might include:

* Ownership of intellectual property and brand assets.
* Money held in the Enspiral Services TEAM account, providing this can be done in a way that satisfies our accountants.
* Physical assets purchased as expenses for the team by Enspiral Services, providing their (now depreciated) value is paid.

###Team Contributions

A proportion of all Enspiral Services contributions will be given into the control of teams. This proportion is currently 1/8th of the total contributions the team makes to the collective funds. Teams have no responsibility to services to spend the money in any particular way, they can spend it all on bouncy castle hire if they like, as long as they meet their team responsibilities. However team funds and their use are not considered to be confidential from others within Services.

##Recruitment

Enspiral Services has always grown carefully and organically. We try and minimise the responsibility that we take on for individuals, and Enspiral Services tries to radically minimise it’s fixed costs, particularly salaries.

Teams may wish to fill that gap and provide some ongoing security to their members, but they must do so in a way that holds no risk to the rest of services.

Without specific agreement from services, a team cannot make an employment agreement with anyone that guarantees their pay, legally or otherwise, without having the money needed to pay for that agreement (for the duration needed to cancel it) sitting in a services account for that purpose.

If a team wishes to guarantee such an agreement via any other means (including overdraft, or another member or account in services used as a guarantor) then it needs agreement from services.

###External Recruitment

Teams tend to develop their own business niche, and thus may end up wanting to bring people into Enspiral Services. Before we had teams, introducing people into services was done in a centralised way. Now that teams wish to do it, we are conscious of ensuring that we don’t flood services with more people than we can support, nor introduce people who don’t share the commitment to the Enspiral vision.

When teams wish to introduce a new person, they have the following responsibilities:

* To ensure that adding the new person is approved in some way according to the team’s processes (such as, but not necessarily, by consensus) so that the rest of Enspiral Services can feel comfortable that inviting the person was the will of the team.
* To ensure that the new person first becomes an Enspiral Contributor, as per the Enspiral People agreement, which in particular means that they need to be sponsored by an Enspiral member. That Enspiral member is saying that they think introducing this person is good for Enspiral. This is not a rubber stamp, we trust the informed judgement of our members, and we expect them to take the responsibility seriously.
* To ensure that the new person has a good experience being invited into the team, and to clearly introduce team processes and culture to new people.
* To ensure that services admin has all the information that is needed to onboard the person to services processes, and in particular the team agrees not to start working with them until they have their services contract signed.
* To introduce the new person to the rest of services. As a contributor they will already be introduced to the rest of Enspiral, but within the context of services, new people need to be introduced in a professional capacity too, explaining why they are working with us, why they are a great fit for Enspiral, and why they are awesome, capable and professional.

###Internal Recruitment

Existing Enspiral Services members can be invited into a team at any time, even more than one. Just be sure to keep the rest of enspiral services informed if the membership of your team changes.

##Agreements

If a team wishes to form a legal contract with any outside party other than our standard client contracts, then it needs permission from services Core Group and the signature of one of the directors.

##Customers

Teams are responsible for providing a good experience to our customers. Even if the team has a strong brand identity, the customer will no doubt be aware that they are dealing with Enspiral Services Ltd, and a bad customer experience can damage all of our livelihoods and also the wider Enspiral brand.

Providing a good customer experience does not mean doing whatever the customer wants, but it does mean managing customer expectations. Teams will clearly set customer expectations for the services that they provide, and then do their very best to meet them. Members of a team are jointly responsible for this, even if they are not doing any work for that project themselves.

Once a period of paid work for a customer is completed, the team is still responsible for our relationship with that customer. A team agrees to ensure that such customers have a way of contacting them again in the future, and that such contact will get a professional response. If a team is unable to handle the further needs of one of their customers, they will find a way to clearly terminate the relationship in a way that satisfies everyone involved, such as by assisting the customer to find another service provider who suits them better.

We all agree to work together at Enspiral Services to ensure that we get a reputation for quality work and professionalism as well as for idealism. Each team takes responsibility for this, but it is considered a collective effort. Teams will attempt to assist each other in furthering this effort by communicating professionally with each other’s customers (should the need arise) and by sharing information on how they are managing customer relationships to assist us all to do better.

##Creating a Team

An aspiring new team in Enspiral Services needs to publish a founding document which explains the team’s purpose and governance structure, and describes any other processes that the team has which relate to the responsibilities of a team as described in this document.

A new team does not need the permission of Enspiral Services to form, but it does need to ensure that it has been clear with its founding document. A new team will run a loomio proposal to seek agreement from the rest of Enspiral Services that their proposed founding document describes everything that it needs to in order to make it clear how the team will fulfill its responsibility. A team does not need the rest of services to agree with its right to form, nor does it need to let the rest of services participate in the drafting of its founding document.

However, if the new team is to be an Enspiral Venture it also needs to seek approval from Enspiral to be created, as per the Enspiral Ventures agreement. [This agreement](https://github.com/enspiral/agreements/tree/master/agreements/ventures.md) outlines how to seek such approval, although it should be noted that Enspiral Ventures typically pay a revenue share to Enspiral Foundation directly, but teams need not do that as they pay their foundation contribution through Enspiral Services. This same process can also be used to convert a team from an internal team to an Enspiral Venture.

##Making a Team into a Company

If a team wishes to leave Enspiral Services and become a company, it can do so with consensus of its members. If that team is already an Enspiral Venture, then it can do so and remain an Enspiral Venture, although it will need to make a new arrangement with Enspiral Foundation regarding its revenue share contribution.

If an internal team leaving Enspiral Services wishes to become a company it may do so, including the transfer of its assets, but if that company wants to become an Enspiral Venture, it must apply to do so as normal.

##Disbanding a Team

A team can be disbanded by consensus of its members.

A team can also be disbanded by consensus of all Enspiral Services members.

However, a team has a responsibility to its existing clients and relationships on behalf on Enspiral Services, and these responsibilities all need to be handed off to other willing volunteers or the responsibilities gracefully ended in a way that doesn’t damage the reputation of Enspiral Services.

On disbanding, team assets are moved into Enspiral Services reserves to be used for other endeavours.
