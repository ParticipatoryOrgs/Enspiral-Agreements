Enspiral Ventures
=================

[April, 2014](https://www.loomio.org/d/BsDreXTV/agreement-enspiral-ventures) | [Overview](https://github.com/enspiral/agreements/blob/master/README.md)


### Background information
Enspiral is a collective of individuals and ventures, this document outlines how this works for individual ventures and how they relate to other parts of the network.

### Enspiral Foundation
The Enspiral Foundation is the charitable company at the heart of the Enspiral network. It owns the Enspiral brand and is the entity with which companies and individuals have a formal relationship.

### Enspiral is not….
* Enspiral is not a traditional incubator or accelerator
* Enspiral does not have any dedicated staff to support Enspiral Ventures

We are a collective of people and companies who support each other to create a thriving society. 

### Benefits

The benefits of becoming an Enspiral Venture are informal but powerful and come down to one core driver, goodwill and trust.
At its heart Enspiral is an altruistic network based on trust that has a vibrant gift economy. When a person or company participates actively in that network they have a whole lot of amazing people and ventures who are in their corner and actively helping them succeed.

* We share leads and connections with each other generously
* We lend each other money and invest in each others’ ventures
* We promote each others’ projects at every opportunity
* We share our learnings and hone our skills together
* We grow a shared brand together to build a reputation greater than the sum of its parts
* We help ventures find great staff and people to find great roles

### Contributions

#### Equity
In the past ventures have contributed equity to the foundation. [This Loomio Decision](https://www.loomio.org/d/ahvSxt9Z/enspiral-ventures-and-equity) returned that equity and our current policy is that the foundation should only hold equity in companies that it has directly financially invested in and not as a contribution for indirect benefits of being part of the network.

#### Revenue
The majority of ventures support the work of the foundation through flexible revenue share agreements. Each venture chooses its own contribution rate and can change it as they choose, [current contribution rates are outlined here](https://docs.google.com/a/enspiral.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AudkcrKwMspodE02OUt4QnVDODMzckt5LUtmcHhpR0E#gid=0). All venture contributions go through the collaborative funding process where the ventures direct what their contribution supports.

#### Other

Ventures are also free to make any other contributions they would like to the Foundation or wider network. This can be in the form of discounted rates, free services or anything else they choose.

### Becoming an Enspiral Venture

#### Process:
1. New company writes a company introduction based on the existing [template](https://drive.google.com/a/enspiral.com/folderview?id=0Bxr3iqrIRxyQakpRN2ZyN29mODQ&usp=sharing#)
1. Their introduction is posted in the members Loomio, to let members know about them and provide a space for discussion, questions, comments, etc (no proposal yet).
1. A one month “getting to know” you phase starts, which goes both ways of them getting to know us and us getting to know them. New company people come on G+ and Loomio, members make an effort to talk to them, meet for coffee, etc, and they ask any questions and clarify the value proposition and values fit on both sides.
1. We ask the company if they definitely want to join, and if so, a proposal is started in the above Loomio discussion for members to officially approve or not.
1. If approved (by consensus - with 75% member engagement), the company and the Foundation officially determine the contribution relationship (revenue share, etc). 
1. We have a welcome celebration!

### Being an Enspiral Venture

### Special Types of Ventures
There are three additional types of Enspiral Ventures which have slightly different relationships with the network. 

#### Enspiral Services Teams
Enspiral Services Limited houses multiple teams who share a common legal structure to increase collaboration and reduce overheads. Some of those teams may apply to be full ventures in their own right. The ones that do act as individual ventures in every other way and the fact they part of Enspiral Services is more of a legal footnote than a substantive difference. 

#### Enspiral Branded Ventures
An Enspiral Branded Venture behaves like a regular venture except it carries the Enspiral name in its title and uses the Enspiral logo as part of its core identity. The shared branding has additional benefits and risks to the network so they have a few more criteria
* All long term team members (directors and employees - excluding external contractors) must be Enspiral Contributors
* If the venture ever leaves the network they must remove any Enspiral branding from their name or logo

#### Enspiral Owned Companies
An Enspiral owned company (eg Enspiral Spaces) is wholly owned by the Enspiral Foundation and are assets that are collectively held by the network.
