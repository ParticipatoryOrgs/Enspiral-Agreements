==========================

[February, 2015](https://www.loomio.org/d/ZFHaUWwN/mastermind-final-step-vote-now-what-should-we-focus-on-in-2015) | [Overview](https://github.com/enspiral/agreements/blob/master/README.md)

**Support our ventures to succeed** - Align our ventures' commercial offerings and strategies, and creating support systems for areas of common need (e.g. profile/resources/talent) to create a thriving ecosystem of growing businesses within Enspiral.

**Tell our story & share learnings with the world** - Build capacity to publicly promote the full range of initiatives emerging out of Enspiral, and extend our collaboration networks. By telling our stories, we hope to inspire others and forge valuable new connections - internally and externally.

**Strengthen & evolve core Enspiral structures** - Clarify and strengthening existing structures and governance and create new ones where needed in order to create the conditions to nurture what weâ€™ve evolved so far and to capitalise on new opportunities in sustainable, accountable, scalable ways.

**Power up the community through internal learning** - Power up our community through actively developing systems and venues for sharing with each other. By doing this, we hope to increase the capacity and skills of everyone in the network.
