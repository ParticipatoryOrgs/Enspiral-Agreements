Enspiral Strategy for 2014
==========================

[March, 2014](https://www.loomio.org/d/yiCk4TEV/confirm-the-official-enspiral-strategy-2014) | [Overview](https://github.com/enspiral/agreements/blob/master/README.md)

Enspiral is a bold experiment to create a collaborative network that helps people do meaningful work. This is the first time in our unfolding journey from possibility to reality that we have tried to form a collective strategy. The intention is to agree on some simple and powerful focus areas that we can use to guide our decisions on where to spend time and money.

It has been an interesting journey to date 

* In year 1 (2010) we were primarily a collective of individuals doing contract work together and excited by the possibility of creating something more. 
* In year 2 we started launching companies (Bucky Box & Legal) and the words Social Enterprise entered our vocabulary. We moved into our new office, hosted our first retreat, launched the Enspiral Foundation and started exploring how a collective of businesses could work together. Yammer became our central comms platform. JV got tired of saying the same thing over and over and made [this video](https://vimeo.com/28573059).
* In year 3 we established a support crew of full time staff, kept holding retreats and starting companies (Metric Engine, Accounting, Chalkle, Loomio). We made [our first loomio decision](https://www.loomio.org/d/nUYtxjHr/we-use-yammer-as-the-basis-for-our-company-documentation), Enspiral Services revenue topped 1.1M and started to feel the stress of a lack of structure - Rabid emerged from the Chaos.
* Year 4 : The support crew quit and heralded in the era of cobudgeting. We bought Southgate Labs out of the office and established Enspiral Spaces. The Enspiral Services core team started meeting regularly and progressively awesomized the company through it’s new teams of Craftworks, Lean, Purposive and Freewheelers. Code Sourced was born and morphed into Enspiral Dev Academy. We ran our first internship program and Social Enterprise conference and closed our first > 1M deal with Lifehack.

So here we are - 130ish people connected through some memories, stories and shared dreams. We are about to enter our 5th year together and have already started out by adding Hipchat as a core comms platform, formalising Enspiral Agreements and welcoming in Volunteer Impact.

The opportunities for Enspiral to develop as a living organism are amazing - however, our resources are limited and we need to focus our energy on the activities which are most important - these collective priorities are reflected in our strategy for 2014.

In 2014, we want to focus on the core of Enspiral - helping Enspiral people and ventures be  more successful. One way of doing so, is by developing and sharing our capabilities which are our main assets. Communication is the lifeblood of our network - improving internal communication is crucial, especially as Enspiral grows. Similarly, communicating to our wider network is important to get support and attention. Lastly, open sourcing how Enspiral works is an efficient way of achieving our core mission beyond the boundaries of our network. 

**Strengthen our Core** - “Focus on our core, namely helping people and companies be more successful in doing meaningful work.” The idea at the heart of Enspiral is about helping people and companies who have a strong social mission succeed at whatever projects they choose to undertake. This is who we are and doing it well is our number one focus for the year (also see [collective vision](https://github.com/enspiral/agreements/tree/master/agreements/vision.md). 

**Capability Development & Sharing** - “Focus on developing skills inside the network by learning from each other and others.” Another way of achieving our core mission is to harness the experience of the collective and generously share our learnings and best practices with each other while bringing in inspirational and talented folks to teach us a thing or two as well.

**Amazing Communications** - “Focus on improving internal and external communication.” Information is the lifeblood of this network and it isn’t strong enough. We are reaching a size where it is extremely challenging to stay aware of what is going on in different parts of the network and new people find it difficult to orient themselves and to connect with meaningful opportunities. Additionally, one of our greatest untapped assets is the good will of our wider networks who if they had a better idea of what we were working on and how they could help would dramatically change our chances of success.

**Open Source Enspiral** - “Focus on making the Enspiral model and organisational structure open source and available for everybody to use and develop.” This will enable other people learn, replicate and improve on what we have created and will increase the amount of ‘people doing stuff that matters’, help improve Enspiral, and build our reputation and audience.



###Implementation
**Implementation Suggestions:**

This strategy is intentionally high level and leaves the details up to individuals and teams in the network to implement as they see fit. 

Members of the Foundation Board have volunteered to facilitate and energize workshops in March around each of the areas (Core - JF, Capability Development - Silvia, Open Source - JV, Comms - Alanna) and the next steps will emerge from those discussions and workshops. Our intention is to develop some key metrics we can report back on for each area but that will be up to the people involved in implementation to figure that out.

Some of the practical implementation ideas: 

* Change bucket proposal form so people have to say which of the 4 their project relates to and explain why.
* The working day around the retreat should be based on these 4 themes.
* Each Foundation Board member champions one of the 4 points.
* Voluntary working groups form around each one to move them forward.
* Enspiral News features each point once per quarter, sharing updates on what people have achieved in that area.
* Foundation Board reports quarterly against these points.
* Define some metrics to measure these
